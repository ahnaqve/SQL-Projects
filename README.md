**Project Aim**
Explore the datasets, analyze the Pizza Place sales and identify the trends and patterns 📈 over the year.

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

Using ad-hoc SQL queries, I have answered below list of questions.

❓ 1. How many orders do we have each day?
❓ 2. Are there any peak hours?
❓ 3. How many pizzas are typically in an order?
❓ 4. Do we have any bestsellers?
❓ 5. How much money did we make this year?
❓ 6. Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
❓ 7. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu?
❓ 8. What is the Month-over-Month growth for pizza sales?
